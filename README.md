# Compiler Project

This is a compiler project developed by Itzik Rahamim as part of the "Compilers" course at SCE Beer Sheva.

## Description

This project is a compiler implementation for a simple procedural language. The compiler consists of three main components:

1. Lexical Analysis: This component uses lex tools to tokenize the input source code and generate the corresponding tokens.

2. Semantic Analysis: This component performs semantic checks on the tokenized code to ensure its correctness according to the language's rules and specifications.

3. Three Address Code Generation: This component generates three-address code, an intermediate representation of the source code that can be further processed or executed.

## Language Description

The language supported by this compiler has the following features:

- Keywords: bool, char, int, real, string, int\*, char\*, real\*, if, else, while, for, var, return, null, void, do
- Operators: &&, /, =, ==, >, >=, <, <=, -, !, !=, ||, +, \*, &
- Literal Lexemes: boolean, char, integers, reals, strings, identifiers, pointers
- Other Lexemes: ;, ,, {, }, (, ), [, ], ...

For more detailed information about the language's syntax and semantics, please refer to the provided language description in the project documentation.
